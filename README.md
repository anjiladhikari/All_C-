* Write a program to set a structure to hold a date (mm,dd and yy), assign values to the members of the structure and print out the values in the format 11/28/2004 by function. Pass the structure to the function

* Write a program using the function overloading that converts feet to inches. Use function with no argument, one argument and two arguments. Decide yourself the types of arguments. Use pass by reference in any one of the function above.

* Define two namespaces: Square and Cube. In both the namespaces, define an integer variable named "num" and a function named "fun". The "fun" function in "Square" namespace, should return the square of an integer passed as an argument while the "fun" function in "Cube" namespace, should return the cube of an integer passed as an argument. In the main function, set the integer variables "num" of both the namespaces with different values. Then, compute and print the cube of the integer variable "num" of the "Square" namespace using the "fun" function of the "Cube" namespace and the square of the integer variable "num" of the "Cube" namespace using the "fun" function of the "Square" namespace.

* Write a function that passes two temperatures by reference and sets the larger of the two numbers to a value entered by user by using return by reference.

* Assume that employee will have to pay 10 percent income tax to the government. Ask user to enter the employee salary. Use inline function to display the net payment to the employee by the company.

* Write a program that displays the current monthly salary of chief executive officer, information officer, and system analyst, programmer that has been increased by 9, 10, 12, and 12 percentages respectively in year 2010. Let us assume that the salaries in year 2009 are

Chief executive officer Rs. 35000/m

Information officer Rs. 25000/m

System analyst Rs. 24000/m

Programmer Rs. 18000/m

Make a function that takes two arguments; one salary and the other increment. Use proper default argument.



* Write a simple program that converts the temperature in Celsius scale to Fahrenheit scale and vice versa using the basic concept of class and object. Make separate classes for Celsius and Fahrenheit which will have the private members that hold the temperature value and make conversion functions in each class for conversion from one to another. For example, you need to have a function toFahrenheit() in class Celsius that converts to Fahrenheit scale and returns the value.

* Assume that you want to check whether the number is prime or not. Write a program that asks for numbers repeatedly. When it finishes checking a number the program asks if the user wants to do another calculation. The response can be 'y' or 'n'. Don't forget to use the object-oriented concept.

* Create a class called carpark that has int data member for car id, int data member for charge/hour, and float data member for the parked time. Make functions to set data members and show the charges and parked hours of the corresponding car id. Make functions for setting and showing the data members. Member function should be called from other functions.

* Write a program with classes to represent a circle, rectangle, and triangle. Each class should have data members to represent the actual objects and member functions to read and display objects, find perimeter and area of the objects, and other useful functions. Use the classes to create objects in your program.

* Assume that an object represents an employee report that contains information like employee id, total bonus, total overtime in a particular year. Use an array of objects to represent n employees' reports. Write a program that displays the report. Use setpara() member function to set report attributes by passing the arguments and member function displayreport() to show the report according to the parameter passed. Display the report in the following format.

An employee with ... ... ... has received Rs ... ... ...as a bonus

and

had worked ... ... ... hours as overtime in the year ... ... ...
